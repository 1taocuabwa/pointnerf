DIN ISO 11469 is an international standard that specifies a system of uniform marking of products that have been fabricated from plastics materials. It provides generic identification of the plastics by symbols and abbreviated terms, as well as additional information on special additives, fillers or reinforcements. The marking system is intended to help identify plastics products for subsequent decisions concerning handling, waste recovery or disposal.

DIN ISO 11469 is based on four other standards that define the symbols and abbreviated terms for plastics materials: ISO 1043-1 for basic polymers and their special characteristics, ISO 1043-2 for fillers and reinforcing materials, ISO 1043-3 for plasticizers, and ISO 1043-4 for flame retardants. These standards provide a comprehensive and consistent nomenclature for plastics materials that can be used in various applications and industries.
 
The marking of plastics products according to DIN ISO 11469 consists of two parts: the basic identification and the additional information. The basic identification includes the symbol ">" followed by the abbreviated term for the polymer or polymer blend, and the symbol "<". For example, ">PE<" stands for polyethylene. The additional information includes the symbols "+" or "-" followed by the abbreviated term for the additive, filler or reinforcement, and the percentage by mass. For example, ">PE+GF30<" stands for polyethylene with 30% glass fiber.

The method of marking plastics products according to DIN ISO 11469 depends on the type, size and shape of the product, as well as the agreement between the manufacturer and the user. The marking can be done by printing, embossing, engraving, stamping or labeling. The marking should be legible, durable and visible. The location and size of the marking should not impair the function or appearance of the product.
