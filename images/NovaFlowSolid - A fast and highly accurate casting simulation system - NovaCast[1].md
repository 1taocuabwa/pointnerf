To use NovaFlow&Solid, you need to follow these basic steps:
 
1. Import or create a 3D model of your casting and mold.
2. Define the material properties, boundary conditions, process parameters and simulation settings.
3. Generate the mesh for the simulation using the finite volume mesh technology.
4. Run the simulation and monitor the progress and results.
5. Analyze the results using various visualization tools and criteria.
6. Optimize your design and process using parameter optimization or design of experiments methods.

NovaFlow&Solid can simulate various aspects of the casting process, such as mold filling, solidification, residual stresses, cracks, deformations, porosity, shrinkage and more. It can also handle complex geometries, multiple cavities, filters, chills, exothermic sleeves and other features. You can export your results in various formats or integrate them with other software tools.
